Emigrant Savings Bank Records: Mortgage and Bond Records
============================================

# Project Overview
## In a Nutshell
Extracting and structuring the building-level mortgage records from Emigrant Savings Bank, one of the first banks to cater to new immigrants in NYC, to create a dataset of financial information about the landholding and financial patterns of new NYC immigrants in the second half of the 19th century and augment our building-level understanding of places in NYC.

## Background
[Emigrant Savings Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigrant_Savings_Bank) is a bank located in NYC founded in 1850 by members of the Irish Emigrant Society and was set up predominantly to cater to the needs of new immigrants in New York, particularly Irish immigrants. While many of their records have been digitized and poured over by generations of genealogists, including through Ancestry.com, their real estate materials appear to be largely unknown and underutilized. 

These include their mortgage and bond records: loans taken out (we suspect mostly by relatively new immigrants) to buy properties and to mortgage existing real estate; an essential step in moving up in New York's economic strata.

We suspect building a keyword searchable, and structured index of names like this will have a tremendous appeal to genealogists

The collection belongs to Manuscripts and Archives, but the primary users are the Milstein Collection (coincidentally, the Milstein family owns Emigrant Savings Bank today).
