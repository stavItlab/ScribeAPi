Emigrant Savings Bank Records: Mortgage and Bond Records
============================================

# Project Overview
## In a Nutshell
Extracting and structuring the building-level mortgage records from Emigrant Savings Bank, one of the first banks to cater to new immigrants in NYC, to create a dataset of financial information about the landholding and financial patterns of new NYC immigrants in the second half of the 19th century and augment our building-level understanding of places in NYC.

## Background
[Emigrant Savings Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigrant_Savings_Bank) is a bank located in NYC founded in 1850 by members of the Irish Emigrant Society and was set up predominantly to cater to the needs of new immigrants in New York, particularly Irish immigrants. While many of their records have been digitized and poured over by generations of genealogists, including through Ancestry.com, their real estate materials appear to be largely unknown and underutilized. 

These include their mortgage and bond records: loans taken out (we suspect mostly by relatively new immigrants) to buy properties and to mortgage existing real estate; an essential step in moving up in New York's economic strata.

We suspect building a keyword searchable, and structured index of names like this will have a tremendous appeal to genealogists for transcription, provide a new source of material for historians, and provide NYPL with useful location data for the NYC Space/†ime directory.

The collection belongs to Manuscripts and Archives, but the primary users are the Milstein Collection (coincidentally, the Milstein family owns Emigrant Savings Bank today).



As the finding aid describes these real estate materials:
> The Bond and Mortgage Books and Bond and Mortgage Ledgers record real estate transactions and have their own numbers which can be found in the Bond and Mortgage Name Index. The entries in the Bond and Mortgage Books include the date of approval, name of mortgagor, house number, size of the ground, description of the building, the amount of the loan, the name of the attorney, and in most cases a drawing of the location on a block map. There are also five Real Estate Loans Ledgers pertaining to the years 1902 to 1923. Information to be found in the Real Estate Loans Ledgers include the applicant’s name, the amount of money requested (at 5% interest) location of ground and building, material the building is to be made of, and the number of floors.

There are about 12,600 mortgages in the 10 reels that make up the Bond and Mortgage holdings.

### Anomalies
* Unreadable elements
* Almost all are located in Manhattan. However some aren't (Morsitania example)
* Some have images pasted over elements. Capture them? But also obscured elements (Morisitania example)


# Project Logistics
## Digitization
The entire collection has been microfilmed and has a [tremendously detailed finding aid](http://archives.nypl.org/uploads/collection/pdf_finding_aid/emigrant.pdf).
